[Hashrate Autopilot](https://github.com/rdouma/hashrate-autopilot) keeps a bid alive on the Braiins Hashpower marketplace within limits the operator sets, and routes the rented hashrate to their own mining setup. It is an application that spends real money on a schedule, so the two facts that matter most about this package are that it starts in DRY-RUN and that its run mode does not retract a bid already placed.

## Image and Container Runtime

One image, built here from source rather than pulled, in one subcontainer.

| Property     | Value                                    |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Image source | `Dockerfile.startos`, built in this repo |
| Architecture | x86_64, aarch64                          |
| Command      | `node packages/daemon/dist/main.js`      |
| Workdir      | `/app`                                   |

| Subcontainer             | Purpose                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `hashrate-autopilot-sub` | The `primary` daemon — the one to `attach` to |

**This repository is a fork of the upstream application, not a wrapper around a released image.** The whole application source is here, and `make` compiles it before packing: `s9pk.mk` calls the root `build` script, which this repo points at `scripts/build-release-inputs.sh` — it builds every workspace `dist/` and then the ncc bundle. `Dockerfile.startos` copies those `dist/` directories, which are gitignored, so that script is the only thing that makes a clean checkout buildable. An upstream version bump is therefore a `git merge`, not a tag change; `UPDATING.md` has the procedure.

## Volume and Data Layout

One volume, holding the SQLite database and any one-time unpaid-history recovery import supplied by an administrator.

| Volume | Mount Point | Purpose                                    |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `main` | `/app/data` | Database state and optional recovery import |

| Path                                  | Written by                  | Holds                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/app/data/state.db`                  | The daemon                  | Operator configuration, encrypted application secrets, runtime state, decision and payout history |
| `/app/data/ocean-unpaid-import.json`  | Administrator, when needed  | Optional `[[tick_at_ms, unpaid_sat], ...]` recovery data for unpaid-history gaps |
| `/app/data/ocean-unpaid-import.imported` | The daemon               | The consumed import, renamed after a successful one-time merge          |

Everything else in the container belongs to the image and is replaced on update. Bitcoin's data directory is also mounted, read-only, at `/mnt/bitcoin` — see [Dependencies](#dependencies).

The recovery import is not part of ordinary operation. On the next start, the daemon merges exact timestamp matches only into unpaid-history rows whose value is missing, never overwrites a live reading, and renames a valid file to `.imported`. A malformed file stays in place and is reported in the service log.

The secrets in that database — the Braiins access token, the dashboard password, Telegram credentials — are encrypted at rest by the application, not by this package. Uninstalling deletes the volume and everything above with it.

## File Models

None. This package writes no configuration file and keeps no `store.json`: everything it has to tell the application is passed as environment on each start, and everything the operator sets lives in the application's own database.

The environment falls into three groups. The first is fixed runtime plumbing:

| Variable            | Value                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`          | `production`                                   |
| `HTTP_HOST`         | `0.0.0.0`                                      |
| `HTTP_PORT`         | The internal service port                      |
| `DB_PATH`           | `/app/data/state.db`                           |
| `DASHBOARD_STATIC`  | The packaged dashboard assets                  |
| `APP_VERSION`       | The packaged upstream version, shown in the UI |

The second is resolved from the dependencies on every start, through `sdk.host.getBridgeAddress`, so no bridge port is ever assumed or written down:

| Variable                  | Resolved from                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BHA_BITCOIND_RPC_URL`    | Bitcoin's RPC binding                                     |
| `BHA_DATUM_API_URL`       | Datum Gateway's web binding                               |
| `BHA_ELECTRS_HOST` / `_PORT` | Electrs's Electrum binding, split into host and port  |
| `BHA_PAYOUT_SOURCE`       | Fixed to `electrs`, since Electrs is a required dependency |

The third is Bitcoin's RPC authentication, read off Bitcoin's own volume rather than asked of the operator: `.cookie` is `__cookie__:<secret>`, and the two halves become `BHA_BITCOIND_RPC_USER` and `BHA_BITCOIND_RPC_PASSWORD`.

**Ownership is the part that surprises people.** The application resolves configuration as *environment beats database beats defaults*, so every variable above is re-asserted on each start and a value edited in the dashboard for one of those fields is overwritten on the next restart. That is deliberate — a saved bridge address goes stale the moment a dependency is reinstalled on a different port. Every other setting in the dashboard belongs to the operator and this package never touches it.

## Dependencies

Three, all required, and all of them must be **synced**, not merely running — a partial answer here is a wrong answer, not a late one.

| Dependency                    | Health checks required   | Why                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Bitcoin (`bitcoind`)          | `bitcoind`, `sync-progress` | Block headers for BIP-110 checks, and the fallback for payout lookups |
| Electrs (`electrs`)           | `electrs`, `sync`        | Address history, for tracking and backfilling payouts                  |
| Datum Gateway (`datum`)       | `datum`                  | Receives the rented hashrate and reports what the pool is producing    |

Bitcoin's `main` volume is mounted read-only at `/mnt/bitcoin`, solely to read its RPC cookie. Nothing is mounted from Electrs or Datum.

Only Datum's daemon check is required, deliberately: its stratum checks describe whether miners are connected, which is exactly the state a new operator has not reached yet, and requiring them would block startup during setup.

**If any of the three cannot be resolved, the daemon refuses to start** with a message naming which one. The alternative — omitting the variable — starts a service that reports no chain tip, no payouts and no pool statistics, which reads as an application bug rather than a missing dependency.

## Network Access and Interfaces

One interface, serving the dashboard, the setup wizard and the API from the same listener.

| Interface | Id   | Type | Port | Description                                        |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Dashboard | `ui` | ui   | 3010 | The dashboard, setup wizard and application API    |

The application's own password protects it once setup is complete; StartOS adds no gate of its own.

Note what this interface is *not*: the Datum statistics address this package resolves is an internal one, for reading pool statistics. The pool URL the operator enters into Hashrate Autopilot is the **public Stratum destination Braiins delivers hashrate to**, and it has to be reachable from the internet. Nothing in this package exposes it — port forwarding and dynamic DNS are the operator's.

## Installation and First-Run Flow

Install the three dependencies first and let them sync; this package will not start until they are up.

On a fresh volume the daemon serves a setup wizard rather than the dashboard. It asks for the Braiins access token, a dashboard password, hashrate and price limits, the public pool destination and the Ocean payout address; the dependency addresses are already filled in from the resolved bindings. Completing it writes to SQLite and turns the same daemon into the running service — there is no separate step and no StartOS action involved.

**The wizard is unauthenticated until it is finished**, because the password it asks for is what protects everything afterwards. Complete first-run setup from a connection you trust.

The controller starts in **DRY-RUN**: it evaluates and records what it would do without placing or changing anything. Promoting it to LIVE is a decision the operator makes on the Status page after reading the decisions it has been proposing.

## Actions

None. Setup, configuration, run-mode selection and diagnostics all live in the application's own dashboard, so there is nothing StartOS can offer that the dashboard does not do better.

## Tasks

None. This package raises no tasks, so the service is never held on a prompt and its ordinary controls are always available.

Dependency requirements are enforced by StartOS's own dependency handling instead, and a dependency that is present but unreachable surfaces as a failed start with an explanatory message in the service log.

## Health Checks

One check, on the only daemon.

| Check     | Displayed   | Method                  |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| `primary` | "Dashboard" | Port 3010 is listening  |

A failure means the daemon exited — most often because a dependency could not be resolved at start, which the service log states directly, naming which one.

Understand what it does **not** cover: a listening dashboard says nothing about whether the Braiins API is reachable, whether a bid is live, whether the pool is receiving hashrate, or whether payouts are arriving. Those are the application's own concern and it raises its own alerts for them, visible on the dashboard and on the Alerts page. A green health check on a service that has silently stopped bidding is expected behavior, not a broken check.

## Backups and Restore

The whole `main` volume is copied wholesale — `sdk.Backups.ofVolumes('main')`. This includes `state.db` and any pending or consumed unpaid-history recovery import. Nothing is excluded.

A restored instance is fully configured: the Braiins token, dashboard password, limits, pool destination and the whole decision and payout history come back with it. Dependency addresses do not need to, since they are resolved fresh on every start, so a restore onto a server whose Bitcoin, Electrs or Datum sit on different ports needs no intervention.

The one thing to decide before restoring is the run mode you want. A backup taken while the controller was LIVE restores as LIVE, and the controller resumes bidding as soon as its dependencies are healthy.

### Advanced unpaid-history recovery

Upstream v1.18.1 can recover unpaid-history samples from an operator-supplied JSON export when the automatic decision-log recovery cannot cover the whole affected period. This requires StartOS administrator access; it is not a dashboard upload.

Validate that the local file contains an array of `[tick_at_ms, unpaid_sat]` pairs, then copy it into the running service:

```bash
start-cli package attach hashrate-autopilot \
  -n hashrate-autopilot-sub -- \
  sh -c 'cat > /app/data/ocean-unpaid-import.json' \
  < ocean-unpaid-import.json
```

Restart Hashrate Autopilot once. A successful import is renamed to `/app/data/ocean-unpaid-import.imported`; an invalid file remains at its original path and the service log explains why. The merge only fills missing values at exact timestamps. Keep an independent backup until the recovered chart and history are verified.

## Limitations and Differences

1. **Run mode does not stop an existing bid.** DRY-RUN and PAUSED prevent new create, edit and cancel calls; neither cancels a bid that is already active, and delivery and spend continue. To stop spending, cancel the bid on the Braiins marketplace and confirm it is inactive there. Keep DRY-RUN on until the targets, price ceilings and proposed decisions all look right.
2. **The setup wizard is unauthenticated until it is completed.** The dashboard password only takes effect afterwards, so run first-run setup from a trusted connection.
3. **Pool ingress is the operator's to arrange.** This package exposes no public Stratum endpoint and configures no port forwarding or dynamic DNS. Verify the exact public pool destination before going LIVE.
4. **The dependency-derived settings are re-asserted on every start** and cannot be changed from the dashboard — the Bitcoin RPC URL and credentials, the Datum statistics URL, the Electrs endpoint, and the payout source. Editing them in the UI appears to work and reverts on the next restart.
5. **Uninstalling deletes everything**, including the encrypted secrets and the full history. Back up first.
6. **x86_64 and aarch64 only.**
7. **This package is a fork of the upstream application**, so what ships is the source in this repository rather than an upstream release artifact. It can therefore lag upstream; the packaged version is in the manifest.
8. **The upstream project is in maintenance mode.** Existing behavior remains available, but upstream no longer has a SHA-256 feature roadmap and future bug-fix support may be limited. Read the project-status notice in the upstream README before relying on future feature work.
